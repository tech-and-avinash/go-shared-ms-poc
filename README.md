# Event Booking Platform

This repository contains a proof of concept (POC) for an event booking platform using Go, gRPC, and a gRPC REST Gateway. The platform is containerized using Docker and deployed using Docker Swarm with Traefik as a reverse proxy.

## Structure

- `api/`: Contains protobuf definitions and generated code.
- `cmd/`: Main entry points for the services.
- `internal/`: Service-specific and shared application logic.
- `deployments/`: Docker and Swarm deployment configurations.
- `pkg/`: Reusable packages and clients.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for building, deploying, and generating code.
- `Makefile`: Simplifies common tasks like building, running, and deploying.

  ## Setup

  1.  **Build Services**

      ```sh
      make build
      ```

  2.  **Run Locally**

      ```sh
      make run
      ```

  3.  **Deploy to Swarm**

      ```sh
      make deploy
      ```

  4.  **Clean Up**
      ```sh
      make clean
      ```
